Control LEDs with Hand Gestures using MediaPipe, OpenCV & Arduino
Control real-world LEDs using your hand gestures captured by a webcam.

➡️ Tech Stack Used:

MediaPipe (for real time hand tracking)

OpenCV (for video processing)

Arduino (for controlling the LEDs)

Python (for gesture detection and serial communication)


➡️ How it works:

Using a webcam and MediaPipe hand tracking, specific finger gestures are mapped to commands (like turning ON/OFF different LEDs). These commands are sent via serial communication to an Arduino, which activates the corresponding LEDs no physical buttons needed!
